# hostapd-config-setup-script
a small CLI based script to set up a hostapd.conf file in a more visual and ' script kiddy ' way. 

this script isnt super convienient on its own but can be pared with other scripts / tools / software for sake of convienience.


1. install python3 libraries from the libraries.txt file.
2. make a file called ' hostapdd_presets ' in the same folder as the python script
3. run ' python3 hostapd_write.py '

in each option (1 , 2) there are help menus. Type ' help ' for them once a option has been chosen
